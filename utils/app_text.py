    INSTRUCTIONS = """How to Use Scorchsoft Text to Mic:

1. Install VB-Cable if you haven't already
https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
This tool creates a virtual microphone on your Windows computer or Mac. Once installed you can then trigger audio to be played on this virual cable.

2. Open the Text to Mic app by Scorchsoft, and input your OpenAPI key. How to set up an API key:
https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/account-setup
(note that this may require you to add your billing details to OpenAI's playground before a key can be generated)
In short, you sign up, go to playground, add billing details, go to API keys, add one, copy it, paste into Text to Mic.

WARNING: This will use your OpenAI key to generate audio via the OpenAI API, which will incur charges per use. So please make sure to carefully monitor use.
OpenAI pricing: openai.com/pricing

3. Choose a voice that you prefer for the speech synthesis.

4. (Optional) Select a Tone Preset to modify how the text is spoken. You can use the built-in presets or create your own under 'Settings > Manage Tone Presets'. Tone presets add special instructions to make the voice sound cheerful, angry, like a bedtime story, etc.

5. Select a playback device. I recommend you select one device to be your headphones, and the other the virtuall microphone installed above (Which is usually labelled "Cable Input (VB-Audio))"

6. Enter the text in the provided text area that you want to convert to speech.

7. Click 'Play Audio' to hear the spoken version of your text.

8. The 'Record Mic' button can be used to record from your microphone and transcribe it to text, which can then be played back.

9. You can change the API key at any time under the 'Settings' menu.
